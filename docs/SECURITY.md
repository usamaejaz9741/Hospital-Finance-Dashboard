# Security Considerations

## Use of localStorage for Authentication Data

Storing user authentication data, such as the user object, in `localStorage` is convenient but can be a security risk.

### The Vulnerability

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the application (e.g., through a third-party library or a vulnerability in the application's code), they can access and exfiltrate any data stored in `localStorage`. This could include sensitive user information and authentication tokens.

### Recommendations

For a production application, it is recommended to use a more secure method for storing authentication data.

- **HttpOnly Cookies**: Storing authentication tokens in `HttpOnly` cookies is a more secure alternative. `HttpOnly` cookies are not accessible via JavaScript, which mitigates the risk of XSS attacks. The server should set the authentication token in an `HttpOnly` cookie upon successful login. This cookie will be automatically sent with every subsequent request to the server.

- **Secure and SameSite Attributes**: When using cookies, ensure they are set with the `Secure` attribute (so they are only sent over HTTPS) and the `SameSite` attribute (to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery - CSRF attacks).

### Implementation for this Project

Since this is a demo project using mock data and no real backend, the use of `localStorage` is acceptable for demonstration purposes. However, if this project were to be moved to a production environment with a real authentication system, it is crucial to switch to `HttpOnly` cookies or another secure mechanism.
