1. Project Vision and Core Objective

The central purpose of the GPAnalytix platform is to bring clarity and insight to the financial and operational performance of nonprofit healthcare organizations. The platform will leverage publicly available data to construct an interactive, visual, and comparative dashboard. This tool is designed to empower users to explore key metrics, understand historical trends, and analyze the factors influencing an organization's financial health.

2. Data Architecture and Sourcing

The platform's analytical power is derived from its ability to integrate three distinct categories of data inputs, creating a holistic view of each healthcare organization.

Data Category	Description	Examples
Structured Data	Primarily PDF documents containing financial tables, notes, and official commentary.	Audited & unaudited financials, bond disclosures & updates, Moody's/S&P/Fitch reports, hospital annual reports, Medicare cost reports, Form 990s.
Unstructured Data	Information gathered through deep web research that provides context to the financial numbers.	Press releases, articles, executive quotes, market share data, demographic information, employment reports, donation data, and documents obtained via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.
Semi-Structured Data	Data on market trends, rankings, and external factors that impact the healthcare landscape.	Market share trends, state healthcare outlooks (e.g., Medicare expansion status), key government healthcare leaders, insurance contract negotiations, quality scores (e.g., Leapfrog), and hospital rankings (US & worldwide).

3. Core Platform Functionality and User Experience

The platform is architected around a principle of progressive disclosure, starting with a high-level overview and allowing users to navigate into granular detail.

* High-Level Dashboard: Users are first presented with a summary dashboard displaying critical metrics derived from financial statements and other data sources.
* Drill-Down Capability: Every metric displayed is clickable, enabling users to explore the specific category in greater detail. This drill-down functionality is the core interactive feature of the platform.
* Dynamic Visualizations: All graphical representations are fully dynamic. Users can toggle between different data breakdowns, such as viewing revenue by type (investment, patient, grants) or by tax status (taxable vs. non-taxable).
* Temporal Analysis with Context: When users drill down into metrics over time, they are presented with:
  * A mini-dashboard for each selected year, highlighting key financial statistics.
  * Contextual annotations or callouts for major events—such as mergers, leadership changes, or macroeconomic impacts—that may have influenced performance.
* Comprehensive Yearly Dashboards: A deep dive into a single year renders a comprehensive, year-specific dashboard offering detailed insights into revenue, costs, assets, liabilities, and contextual analysis of trends and anomalies.
* Advanced Analytical Tools: The platform enables sophisticated analysis through features that allow for:
  * Historical financial reviews spanning multiple fiscal years.
  * Side-by-side comparisons of any two or more metrics (e.g., Cash vs. EBIDA, Revenue vs. Debt).
  * Filtering and comparison of revenue vs. cost trends.
  * Cross-year trend analysis, ratio insights, and growth delta calculations.

4. Detailed Financial Statement Visualization

The platform will render specific, detailed visualizations for key components of an organization's balance sheet and income statement, often integrating data from financial notes to provide a more complete picture.

4.1. Balance Sheet Metrics

* Cash and Cash Equivalents: Displayed as a simple annual bar graph showing the trend over time.
* Liquid Investments: Visualized with an annual bar graph to track trends in this specific asset class.
* Accounts Receivable: Presented as a single bar graph per year. If sourced from two separate lines in the financials, the bar will be split to show the composition of the total receivable amount.
* Short Term Assets Limited as to Use (ALAU): An annual bar graph will illustrate the trend of these restricted assets.

4.2. Income Statement Metrics

Revenue Analysis

* Patient Revenue: This key metric receives a multi-layered visualization.
  * Primary View: An annual bar graph (spanning 8-10 years) with each bar segmented into three payer categories: Government (Medicare/Medicaid), Commercial, and Self Pay.
  * Percentage Overlay: A line graph will be layered on top to indicate the percentage contribution of each payer category to the total patient revenue for that year.
  * Drill-Down: Selecting a segment (e.g., Government) will provide a further breakdown if available (e.g., Medicare vs. Medicaid).
  * Data Toggles: Users can toggle the view between Source of Revenue (payer type) and Type of Revenue (Inpatient, Outpatient, Physician Services), as well as by Entity (Hospital, Other Obligated Entities, etc.).
* Other Revenue: Visualized as a single annual bar, with a layer to show its percentage of total revenue. It will also feature a toggle to view by generating entity. Important contextual notes, such as the recognition of COVID relief funds, will be attached to the relevant year's data.
* Donations: A historical bar chart will show annual donation totals, with each bar divided to distinguish between "New Donations" (charitable contributions without donor restrictions) and "Donations released from restrictions."

Expense Analysis

* Categorization: Expenses will be visualized in an annual bar chart, with each bar segmented into three primary categories:
  1. Salaries, Benefits and Wages (includes Employee Benefits)
  2. Non-Labor Spend (includes Supplies, other expenses, and Purchased Services)
  3. Finance-Related Expenses (Depreciation and Interest Expense)
* Functional Features:
  * Filtering: Users can de-select categories to view specific expenses in isolation.
  * Percentage View: A toggle option will show expenses as a percentage of total revenues to track spending efficiency.
  * Inflation Overlay: When viewing isolated non-finance expenses, a layer showing inflation can be applied to measure real spend against inflation.
  * Integration of Notes: Critical details from financial notes (e.g., lease payments included in "supplies and other expenses") will be surfaced and linked to the corresponding expense data.

Income and Profitability Analysis

* Operating Income: The platform will display annual operating income (revenue minus expenses) to show yearly patterns. A crucial feature is a toggle switch labeled "EBIDA" that recalculates and displays operating income without the "Finance-Related Expenses" (Depreciation and Interest).
* Other Income: This will be graphed annually to show historical trends, with investment income being the primary component. Each bar will be broken down by the type of investment income: "Interest, Dividends and Other," "Net Realized Gains," and "Net Unrealized Gains." This data is typically sourced from the financial notes.
* Net Total Income: This figure, often labeled "Excess of revenues" on financial statements, will be displayed annually with a layer to show the year-over-year percentage change.
* Bottom Line / Equity: The final comprehensive number reflecting all revenues, expenses, investments, and donor activity, typically found as the last line in the balance sheet, will also be tracked.

5. Design and Functional Inspiration

The development of the GPAnalytix platform is guided by the user-centric design and functionality of established financial platforms.

* Simply Wall Street: This platform serves as inspiration for its effective use of visual infographics, performance snapshots, and interactive charts that make complex financial data accessible and easy to understand.
* Yahoo Finance: Its architecture informs the GPAnalytix design through its use of detailed financial tables, metric toggles for customized views, and peer comparison capabilities.

Together, these influences shape the platform's commitment to combining a clean, visual design with a robust and functionally deep architecture for comprehensive financial analysis.
